This project is part of my MSIM coursework(Interactive Information Visualization). I was assigned to create an interactive visualization software for a dataset of my interest. I have chosen the U.S population dataset that includes the election results. 

This folder contains the code for the U.S population and census data visualization. It includes the data set, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and D3 code. A document that describes this project is also included.
